Class Attribute: Check that class attribute based XPath is well formed

[Scenario]
Click the blue button and press ok in alert popup

[Young's comment]
This page is for XPATH exercise but I used CSS selector as it's easy to use and simple. And see how to handle with alert popup in both Playwright and Selenium
