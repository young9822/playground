# Young's Playground
Here is Young's playground for testing with automation. Please refer to the following for the detail.

## Case 1: test a e-commerce website using Page Object Model
A page object is an object-oriented class that serves as an interface to a page of your AUT. The tests then use the methods of this page object class whenever they need to interact with the UI of that page. The benefit is that if the UI changes for the page, the tests themselves donâ€™t need to change, only the code within the page object needs to change.

## Case 2: compare Playwright and Selenium
This webcite is specially designed to exercise the special cases such as dynamic ID, hidden button, hidden layers, load delay. (not from me) Usually it's not easy to haddle these kind of cases. I developped the sample test scripts with both Playwright and Selenium to compare. Do you think which is better?
